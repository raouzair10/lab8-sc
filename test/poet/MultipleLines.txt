In the moonlit night you may find me
A silent dance of shadows a symphony

Whispers in the breeze Seek to explore
New horizons beckon strange life to adore

In the garden of dreams where fantasies write
Treading paths unknown where imaginations take flight

Underneath the stars a promise to keep
A secret trod softly as the world falls asleep

In the moonlit night you may write me
A silent dance of shadows a symphony
